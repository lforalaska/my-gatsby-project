Asking for help is one of the best ways to grow. In my experience, those who are shy about asking for help tend to come from disadvantaged backgrounds. They want to make sure they've tried absolutely everything before asking, especially if they view the helper as someone whose extremely busy. Or in other cases, they're afraid of looking a fool by asking "stupid" questions, so they want to make sure their question is accompanied by answers. 

Humility and thoroughness are both traits to admire, but they are also impediments to learning quickly. My goal is to show you how to ask for help in a way that won't annoy the helper or look stupid (sort of).

## Industry

There's two types of industry help. One for getting a job and one for succeeding at your job. 

### How to ask someone for a job

Let's assume you need a job from someone you do not know. What's the best way to ask? This answer will vary depending on your industry, I will answer it from the tech industry perspective. 

First off, cold emails/LinkedIn messages/Twitter DM's are totally fine. For the most part, people are willing to help strangers and will respond to cold asks. Your mileage will vary depending on 1.) your verbosity and 2.) your call to action. In general, keep the message short and polite, but be direct with your ask. 

**Good message:**

> Hi Lilly! I read your recent work on \[x] thing and I love it for \[y] reasons. I'm a college student at \[z] school. I'd love to spend a summer internship working with you on \[x]. 

**Bad message:**

> Hi Lilly! I read your recent work on \[x] thing and I love it for \[y] reasons. I'm a college student at \[z] school studying \[something similar to x]. If you have the time, I'd love to connect with you more about \[x].

The difference is pretty subtle. In this example, the problem with the bad message is there's no direct call to action. The bad message doesn't tell me clearly what the person wants and therefore I can't accurately prioritize their message. Moreover, I find that when I do agree to "connect" with people who send vague messages, they're also not sure what they want from me either. The result is the marginal value for the marginal cost is not very high because we have to spend time figuring out what the ask even is. 

Generally, it's also a good idea to ask for async help whenever possible. Async help refers to responses in text through email, DM's, or even tweets. This lets the helper respond when it is convenient for them, which is important when trying to get a response to a cold ask. Cold asks for phone calls are a lot more friction for me. 

*It's important for cold messages to have a direct call to action with the smallest friction possible.*
