Asking for help is one of the best ways to grow. In my experience, those who are shy about asking for help tend to come from disadvantaged backgrounds. They want to make sure they've tried absolutely everything before asking, especially if they view the helper as someone whose extremely busy. Or in other cases, they're afraid of looking a fool by asking "stupid" questions, so they want to make sure their question is accompanied by answers. 

Humility and thoroughness are both traits to admire, but they are also impediments to learning quickly. My goal is to show you how to ask for help in a way that won't annoy the helper or look stupid (sort of).
