A common question I get is "What if I don't have any internships?". What exactly goes on the resume if there's no previous job history? If you are in this position, there's a few things you can highlight.

## Portfolio

The goal of the technical portfolio is to show you are capable of using some different technologies and you have an interest in tinkering. While of course, having something extremely impressive like the top game in the app store or a website that gets 1M users would be preferable, it's also not realistic. A good portfolio does not need to be filled with incredible and amazing apps and projects. It needs to be filled with *completed* projects*.*

A completed project can be entirely understood without explanation from you. They do not necessarily need to be a website or an app or a game. It can be a few graphs from a dataset you found interesting and a writeup on what these visualizations imply. It could be your personal website with just a few things about yourself. It can be documentation for a specific feature on an open source project.

Let's think about that last example of writing documentation. Perhaps the technical knowledge was actually relatively simple. Why highlight it? Because software engineering is often trying to address scale. In order to build something at scale, you have to scale people. However, as you increase the number of people, the marginal effective labor of each person goes down. Think about the last time you wrote a piece of code yourself versus when you needed to coordinate with someone else to write it. With one other person, maybe you just had an email chain you sent back and forth. With 10, you'll probably require in person meetings and regular syncing. At 100? 1,000? It doesn't even become reasonable to coordinate a meeting at that point. That is why writing is important. Having good examples of writing in your portfolio is a big plus because interviews typically don't cover this skill.

## Extracurriculars

These are clubs, groups, and events that you participate in outside of academics or jobs. The reason you highlight extracurriculars is to show you have soft skills like planning, people relations, and getting an idea from conception to execution. 

I read a resume once from a student who was on an executive board for an Asian American student group. His bullet point underneath said "Balanced an $8,000 budget; Headed an Asian-themed fashion show event". What he actually did was:

1. Nurtured an intense passion and love for fashion
2. Conceived of an idea to combine his unique skills and community together
3. Organized the location, the models, the budget, and the schedule
4. Made actual clothes for the models to wear
5. Marketed and drove turnout for over a hundred people

That's a lot of impressive work that isn't being highlighted properly with just "Headed an Asian-themed fashion show event". Give the metrics and the details that showcase your skills. If you are doing so on a website, include pictures! 

## Narrative

Hiring, from the company perspective, is about reducing the risk that the new hire is a lemon. Perfectly good candidates will get passed on because there is uncertainty. By telling your narrative, you give the company a look into your riskiness-- and potential. 

Your narrative should come in a few different forms. A tagline on a resume, an elevator pitch on a LinkedIn profile, and maybe a long form story on a website. The goal of your narrative is largely up to you. Some people strive to demonstrate they're hardworking and quick learners. Others want to highlight their technical prowess. 

I remember one student who had no extracurriculars or portfolio work because she was working a full time job at Chipotle while pursuing her college degree. Her preferred career path was finance and she wasn't sure how to get her first job. In her cover letters and statements, she told her story. How she was a full scholarship first generation college student, how she's been working at Chipotle since she was 15 and was now a manager, how she struggled but love math. 

The goal of the first job is to get your foot in the door. If you can tell your story, it only takes one person to give you a chance.
